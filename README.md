# cli-gui

This is still hugely a work in progress.

There's still much to be done but I am pretty happy with how this library is developing.
It started out as a simple implementation of ansi escape codes as a mean to both exercise a little bit in C and create something useful, then I lost my hand.
I'm having fun with such a low level (compared to what I usually program with) language code. Memory handling is not that easy if you are not used to it!
